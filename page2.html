                    <p class="text">Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that
                        tends to focus on a "combination of low-life and high tech" featuring advanced technological
                        and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and cybernetics, juxtaposed with a
                        degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order. Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the
                        New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick,
                        Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer and Harlan Ellison examined the
                        impact of drug culture, technology, while avoiding the utopian
                        tendencies of earlier science fiction.</p>
